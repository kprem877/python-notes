Notes on Python3:

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashed work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
    - Like this
    - And this

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings . Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading size

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised...I beat the Borg with it.

> - Captain Janeway
